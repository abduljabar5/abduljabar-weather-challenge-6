# abduljabar-weather-challenge-6


## Discription
This project was very difficult, but what kept me motivated were the little challenges I had to overcome to complete it. The purpose of this project was to create a weather application, which meant I had to write JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from scratch. I added a weather API and used BootStrap to make the application look more professional.
